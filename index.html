      <h2>Project Context and Creative Roles</h2>
      <p>Each of the audiovisual works presented in my portfolio serves as a step in my ongoing artistic development — either in collaboration with other directors or through authorial initiatives. These projects span fiction and essay film, combining elements of performance, research, and editing experimentation.</p>
      <p>My roles have varied across productions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>As a Director</strong>: I was responsible for the overall creative vision, guiding the story’s visual and emotional arc from pre-production to post. In <em>Karoshi</em>, for instance, I also co-wrote the screenplay, merging narrative structure with visual rhythm and tone.</li>
        <li><strong>As an Assistant Director (AD)</strong>: I worked to bridge the gap between the creative intent of the director and the logistical execution of the set. In both <em>A Caixa</em> and <em>Mozart: o Brasil em 1m²</em>, my tasks included managing the shooting schedule, organizing the crew and cast flow, and ensuring that each take aligned with the overall vision and time constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>As an Editor</strong>: Particularly in the essay film <em>Dissídio</em>, I developed a montage rooted in archival imagery and poetic juxtaposition. This work required crafting a rhythm and meaning almost entirely through editing, with no live-action footage.</li>
        <li><strong>As a Screenwriter</strong>: My contribution came in building themes and character arcs that aligned with the director’s vision, focusing on story economy and internal structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These experiences not only reflect my technical range but also my ability to collaborate in different roles within independent film environments, especially in Brazilian short-form productions. Each project was an opportunity to refine my sensitivity to pacing, tone, and narrative intention — whether directing, supporting direction, assembling a film in the edit, or constructing its textual foundation.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Brazilian filmmaker and assistant director. I studied Film Directing at the Academia Internacional de Cinema (Filmworks program) and currently pursue a professional acting course at Escola de Teatro Macunaíma. I also hold degrees in International Relations (PUC-SP, 2012) and Economics (Insper, 2018), which enrich my creative perspective in visual storytelling.</p>
